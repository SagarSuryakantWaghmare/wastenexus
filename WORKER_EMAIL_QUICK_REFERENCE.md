2. **Admin Reviews**

   - Go to: `/dashboard/admin/workers`
   - Click pending application

3. **Verify or Reject**
   - Click "Verify" → Worker gets credentials email
   - Click "Reject" → Worker gets rejection email

4. **Worker Logs In**
   - Use credentials from email
   - Change password immediately

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Passwords are bcrypt hashed (10 rounds)
- ✅ Temporary password format: `Worker@xxxxxxxx`
- ✅ Credentials ONLY in email (not API response)
- ✅ Gmail App Password (not account password)
- ✅ Worker must change password on first login

## 📊 Success Indicators
