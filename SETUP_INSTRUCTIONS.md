## 🔄 Next Steps (For Full Production)

1. **Replace Base64 with Cloudinary**:
   - Uncomment Cloudinary upload in API routes
   - Images currently stored as base64 (works but not optimal)

2. **Add Authentication Middleware**:
   - Protect API routes with JWT verification
   - Currently uses localStorage user data

3. **Real AI Integration**:
   - The Gemini API is set up but simulated for testing
   - Remove mock data in production

4. **Add Real-time Updates**:
   - WebSocket for live status updates
   - Push notifications for report status changes

5. **Seed Database**:
   - Add sample events
   - Add reward items
   - Add sample marketplace listings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?
- Check Cloudinary credentials
- For now, base64 storage works

### AI not working?
- Verify GEMINI_API_KEY in `.env.local`
- Check API quota limits

### Data not loading?
- Ensure MongoDB is connected
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is logged in (localStorage)
